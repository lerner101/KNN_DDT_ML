## Machine Learning Classification Project: KNN and Decision Trees Analysis on Health Datasets

This project focuses on the implementation and comparison of two fundamental machine learning classification techniques: K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Trees (DTs), applied to two distinct health-related datasets. The goal is to demonstrate the process of programming for machine learning, from data acquisition and preprocessing to running experiments and evaluating the performance of models. This initiative provides a comprehensive exploration into the practical applications of these algorithms, offering insights into their effectiveness and utility in health data analysis.

### Project Overview

The project encompasses several key phases:

- **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: We source data from two datasets: The NHANES Age Prediction Subset and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset. The data is carefully cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring it is suitable for the subsequent machine learning tasks.

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Both the K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Trees algorithms are implemented from scratch. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the algorithms' mechanics and their application in real-world scenarios.

- **Experimental Analysis**: We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the KNN and DTs models on the health datasets. This includes analyzing their accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for different types of health data.

- **Performance Comparison**: A comparative analysis is performed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm across the datasets. This provides valuable insights into which models are more effective under various conditions.

### Datasets

- **NHANES Age Prediction Subset**: A collection of health and nutritional data aimed at predicting age.
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)**: A dataset containing features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses, used to predict whether the masses are malignant or benign.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing algorithms and conducting experiments.
- **Libraries**: Utilizes general utility libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy to aid in data visualization and numerical computations.

### Usage

This repository serves as a resource for individuals interested in machine learning, particularly in the context of health data analysis. It offers a practical guide on implementing classic classification algorithms and provides a foundation for further exploration and development of machine learning models.
